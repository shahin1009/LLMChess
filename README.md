# LLMChess

Integrating Language Models and Robotics for Chess.

The project demonstrates how to combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with a simulated robotic arm to perform the complex task of playing chess.

The system interprets high-level strategic instructions and natural language commands, validates them against the rules of chess and the physical environment, and executes the moves using a UR5e robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator.
