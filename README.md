Integrating Language Models and Robotics for Chess
This repository contains the code for the project "Integrating Bayesian Optimization, Reinforcement Learning & Language Models in Robotics," specifically focusing on Chapter 3: Language Models in Robotics. The project demonstrates how to combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with a simulated robotic arm to perform the complex task of playing chess.

The system interprets high-level strategic instructions and natural language commands, validates them against the rules of chess and the physical environment, and executes the moves using a UR5e robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator.
